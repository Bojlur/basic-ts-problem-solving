What is the use of enums in TypeScript? Provide an example of a numeric and string enum?

Enums are one of the few features TypeScript has which is not a type-level extension of JavaScript.
Enums allow a developer to define a set of named constants. Using enums can make it easier to document intent,
or create a set of distinct cases. TypeScript provides both numeric and string-based enums.

How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?

By providing a strong typing system, advanced features, and enhanced readability,
TypeScript helps developers write cleaner, more efficient code that is easier to understand and maintain.
As a result, projects developed with TypeScript are more likely to be successful, scalable, and maintainable in the long run
